# How It works
EasyPay works by tapping an EasyCard on a payment terminal. EasyCards will be
linked to user phone numbers upo activation.

#### EasyCards
These are MIFARE NFC cards that served as debit-card equivalents that might
have been easier for onboarding the unbanked population to use.

###### EasyCard Top-Up
The EasyCards are recharged following these steps:
* Buy a recharge card from our outlets or authorized resellers
* Go to payment kiosks, tap your EasyCard and select "Recharge" option
* Scan the barcode on the recharge card as instructed

#### Paying for Parking
* **LCD**: Shows parking rates, hours, time limit and other information
* **Keypad**: Enter your space number here first. Your space number is located
  on the curb next to your car.
* **Paying**: Enter space number, then press [OK]. Use [up] and [down] to change
  time. Press [OK] to complete transaction. System will ask you to tap your
  card. Do this and done. No receipt is necessary.
